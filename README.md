### Topics need to cover in Python
1. Operators
2. Boolean Exp
3. if...else
4. loops
5. Functions
6. Lists
7. Tuple
8. Object Oriented Programming- Classes & objects
9. Constructor

### Pthon's features:
* Easy to learn, read, maintain, interactive.
* Interpreted language
* A broad standard library
* Free and Open Surce
* Interactive Mode: Debugging
* Databases
* GUI Programming.

  ### Who uses Python
  * Google
  * PBS
  * NASA
  * Librariy of Congress
  * Instagram
 
### Others features:
* Easy-to-learn.
* Code is 3-5 times shorter than Java.
* 5-10 times shorter than C++.
* Since it allows you to express very powerful ideas in very few lines of code while being very readable.
* Not only a Scripting language, also support Web Development and Database Connectivity.
* Rising Demand for Python Programmers.
* Google, Nokia, Disney, Yahoo, IBM use Python.

### Installing Python:
* Download Python from www.python.org
* IDLE: Integrated Development and Learning Environment.

#### Python
* A variale can refer to an object of any type.
* Main drawback: type errors are only cought at runtime.

#### Indentation in Python:
* Use identation for blocks, instead of curly bracket.
* The delimiter followed in Python is a colon (:) and indent spaces or tabs.
#### Others
* The Print() Function
* Assigning values to a variable
* Multiple assignment
* Comments
* Unary & Binary operations
* Division(/) Opreataor and floor Division Operators
* Module (%) Operator
* The exponent operator 
  
#### User Input
##### Program execution Cycle:
* Source Code => Byte Code => PVM

#### Input:
* The input (string) method returns a line of user input as a string.
* The string can be converted by using the conversion methods int(string) converts to int, float(string) converts to float or eval(string) converts and evaluates expressions etc.

##### Arithmetic Questions:
1. Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
   * The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
   * The second line contains the difference of the two numbers.
   * The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
  
2. Read two integers and print two lines.
   * The fisrt line should contain integer division.
   * The seconf line contain float division.

3. Calculate an average marks of 5 students.

#### Tokens in Python:
| Tokens                                                              | Meanings and Examples                                                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keywords| Reserved words (ex:, if, else, for)
| Identifiers | Name used to defines/find variables
| Operators | Used to perform operators.(<,>,+,* etc)
| Delimeters | Symbols to perform operators. (:, ',', ;, etc
|Literals | Can be anything number of string(78, '21.90')

#### Python Core Types (Data Types)
| Types                                                               | Examples                                                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Integer | 10, 20, -2, etc
| 2. Float | 12.34, 45.21, 12.766, etc
| 3. Complex | 1 + 4j, 2 - 8j
| 4. Boolean | True, False
| 5. String | 'Hello World', "bye"

#### Object Characterisation:
| Types                                                               | Examples                                                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Identity | id(x)
| 2. Type | type(x)
| 3. Value |

#### Expressions in Python
1. A data value or set of operation to compute a value.
* Example: 1+4*3

2. Arithmetic Operator:
* = - *
* 5
* **

3. Precedence: Order in which operators are computed.
   * / % ** have a higher predence than +, -
   * Parenthesis can be used to force a certain evaluation.
   * (1+3) * 4 is 16
